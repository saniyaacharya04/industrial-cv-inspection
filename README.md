# Industrial Safety & Asset Inspection using Computer Vision

This project implements an industrial inspection system using **Computer Vision, Object Detection, and OCR** to simulate safety compliance and asset monitoring in manufacturing environments.

## 🔍 Features
- YOLO-based object detection for:
  - Person
  - Safety Helmet
  - Industrial Equipment
- OCR-based extraction of:
  - Equipment IDs
  - Meter readings
  - Warning labels
- Automated safety compliance checks
- REST API for inspection using FastAPI
- Planned Docker-based deployment
- Model benchmarking using Precision, Recall, F1-score & inference latency

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (Ultralytics)
- Tesseract / EasyOCR
- Scikit-learn
- FastAPI
- Docker
- Git

## 📊 Use Case
This system simulates how industrial AI platforms monitor:
- Worker safety compliance
- Equipment labeling
- Asset inspection using machine vision

## 🚧 Project Status
**In Progress** – Core CV pipeline implemented, deployment & benchmarking under active development.
